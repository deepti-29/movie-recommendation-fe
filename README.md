# Movie Recommender Frontend

This repository contains the code for the vue app which is the frontend for [MOVIEMANIA - movie recommendation tool](http://succinct-foot.surge.sh/#/) whose backend repository is [movie-recommendaer-be](https://github.com/deepti-29/movie-recommendation-fe/tree/master).

It is a simple, single page VueJS app create from vue cli, which take two user inputs and feeds them to the API backend hosted on heroku. The API takes the inputs and provides response based on a preprocessed movie matrix data and pretrained machine learning model which utilises kNN algorithm.
